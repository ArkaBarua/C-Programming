| r    | Opens an existing text file for reading purpose                                                                                                                                 |
| w    | Opens a text file for writing. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your program will start writing content from the beginning of the file.                   |
| a    | Opens a text file for writing in appending mode. If it does not exist, then a new file is created. Here your program will start appending content in the existing file content. |
| w+   | Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It first truncates the file to zero length if it exists, otherwise creates a file if it does not exist.                         |
| r+   | Opens a text file for both reading and writing.                                                                                                                                 |
| a+   | Opens a text file for both reading and writing. It creates the file if it does not exist. The reading will start from the beginning but writing can only be appended.           |
